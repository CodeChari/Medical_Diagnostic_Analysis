************! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)
Probably somebody else has pushed to master already, and your commit is behind. Therefore you have to fetch, merge the changeset, and then you'll be able to push again.

try:

git fetch origin master
git merge origin master
After to wrote this code I received other error: (non-fast-forward)


then

git fetch origin master:tmp
git rebase tmp
git push origin HEAD:master
git branch -D tmp
