************! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)
Probably somebody else has pushed to master already, and your commit is behind. Therefore you have to fetch, merge the changeset, and then you'll be able to push again.

try:

git fetch origin master
git merge origin master
After to wrote this code I received other error: (non-fast-forward)


then

git fetch origin master:tmp
git rebase tmp
git push origin HEAD:master
git branch -D tmp


normal git commands
in local repo:
             git init
             git add .
             git commit
             
connecting to central repo
             git remote add origin git@github.com:username/new_repo
               above command is for connection via ssh, below isfor hhtp(it will ask for password again and again, i.e not reccomended)
             git remote add origin https://github.com/username/new_repo

             then
             git push -u origin master

            above commad will open ur fav text editor(that u have set during installation), for commit massage.
             

once all of this setup done, you have to repeat these three commands
           git add .
           git commit
           git push -u origin master
